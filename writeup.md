## Summary
The data visualization made tends to explore the survival chances of passengers aboard the Titanic. The graphs show the survival chances depending upon gender, age, port from which the person embarked and passenger class. I have also explored the age and and price fare of passengers aboard the Titanic and tried to relate the survival according to it.

## Design
* Each factor( Age Group, Ticket Class, Gender , Embarked from) with survival rate of the passenger is considered. 
* A bar charts for looking at how each factor affect survival rates. S
*Average survival rate on Vertical axis and each factor( Age Group, Ticket Class, Gender , Embarked from) in Horizaontal axis to compare with the survival rate


## Feedback
* In Survived visualization, there is no clear label 
  * I changed 0 to dead and 1 to alive
* Age figures are sloppy.
  *  I put histograms in three categories. 

* In class visualization,  it is not clear how many survive out of what total number of people in each class. 
  * I changed to percentage. 
  
* In Embarked visualization, there is no explanation for null and C, Q, S?
  * I speciied the towns accordingly.
  
* Embarked Graph could be visually better in presentation
  * I adjusted the size of the figure.
  
* There is no text explanation. 
  * I put explanations.
  
* Gender Graph could be visually better in presentation
  * I adjusted the size of the figure 

* In your “Design” section please also explain: How did you make your initial visualization decisions? Please justify your decisions of the chart types, legends, etc in the visualization. For example, you can say "I chose bar charts for reasons A and B ..."
  *Design section of the writeup is filled
  
* Your visualizations are great. In order to evaluate this section we also need to compare your initial design to final design (after feedback revision) therefore for the next submission, please include 2 links in your write-up, one for the initial design and one for the final version and also please document the changes you've made more in detail in the write-up. For example, you can say based on Feedback "A", I decided to change the plot's type or any other modifications that you have made. We basically want to see how did you improve your project base on the received feedbacks.
  * Two links are provided
